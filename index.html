  <h1>Tl;dr Travel</h1>
  <p class="subheader">A collection of interactive, short-form travel guides 
  to help simplify your trip planning</p>

  <div class="main-description">

  <p>Your time is valuable, so why read giant blocks of text when you don't have 
  to? We provide starting points on topics we think you'd find useful, written 
  as concisely as possible.</p>

    <p>All guides are currently based on our group of friends' travel experiences, 
  curated from what we enjoyed during our time in the places.</p>

    <p>These guides are meant to help you start your trip planning; not intended 
  to be comprehensive.</p>
