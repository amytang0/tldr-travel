<!-- see http://www.xe.com/iso4217.php#A for current currency code -->

<!-- some basic information about the country, can add or remove sections as 
needed -->
##Logistics##

<!-- currency data auto-updated from latest if API endpoint still working -->
- __Currency:__ Cordoba (1 USD = ~<span data-currency="{{ page.currency }}" id="currency">27.55</span> Cordoba)
- __Tourist Visa:__ None for US/Canada, but $20USD entrance fee
- __Vaccinations:__ <a href ="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/nicaragua">Several recommended.</a> Malaria pills recommended for Bluefields and Rio San Juan area. Carry Yellow Fever vaccination card if planning to cross country borders.

##Food##

- __Eat:__ Gallo Pinto, plantains, fried chicken, fried fish. Food is usually ~$5USD or 120NIO.
- __Water:__ Bottled water recommended usually
- __Drinking Age:__ 18, but everyone drinks and no one cares
- __Tipping:__ In western restaurants (especially in Granada), tipping is expected. In comiderias/local stands, not expected.

##Transportation##

- __Public:__ Public transit is huge in Nicaragua. Chicken buses (i.e. decommissioned US school buses) can take you to every part of the country, but are uncomfortable and slow. Chicken buses range between $1-$8 USD depending on how far you're going. Taxis are the usual way to get around inside a city, usually costing $10-20NIO at a time. 
- __Car:__ No idea what prices. The roads are very poorly maintained and the locals drive crazy.

##Survival##

- __SIM Card:__ Two options for SIM cards: Movistar and Claro. Claro(red and white) has faster speeds and better coverage but is slightly more expensive. Prepaid Claro cards are $12NIO and can be topped up online or at any pulperia sporting the red and white Claro sign. It's $130NIO for 7 days of 1GB of data.  
- __Washrooms:__ Sometimes the washrooms don't have toilet paper, but often they are stocked and fairly clean. Throw toilet paper into bin; sewage systems are old and can't handle paper.

<div class="city" data-name="Managua">
#Managua#

The capitol. Not that interesting and most crime-filled city of Nicaragua. Do not take street taxis here at night and make sure you regularly check that all possessions are on you.
</div>

<div class="city" data-name="Granada">
#Granada#

Beautiful old colonial city. Main city of the Conservatives during the Civil War. A huge number of expats live here. Has a rivalry with Leon. Sit in the Parque Central and eat a vigoron (fried pork skin with boiled yuca and cabbage). There's the nearby Isletas and Laguna de Apoyo.
</div>

<div class="city" data-name="Leon">
#Leon#
![Leon](leon.jpg)
Has some nice colonial architecture. Main city of the rebel Sandinistas during the Civil war. Has some really beautiful art museums and good revolutionary history museums. Revolutionary art murals everywhere. Slightly less touristy than Granada. A good hub to check out the nearby volcanoes Selva Negra, Telica, and El Hoyo. You can go volcano-boarding off Selva Negra.
</div>

<div class="city" data-name="Chinandega">
#Chinandega#
Hot and dusty. Flor de Cana rum factory tours nearby. Otherwise, basically only good as a transportation hub.
</div>

<div class="city" data-name="Jiquilillo">
#Jiquilillo#
![Jiquilillo](jiquilillo.jpg)
Teeny little fishing village with a population of ~100 people. Close to Padre Ramos Estuary and San Cristobal volcano. Great place to go surfing (low tide good for noobs, high tide good for experts). Highly recommend Rancho Esperanza to stay as they have good food and genuinely help out the community.
</div>

<div class="city" data-name="Estelí">
#Estelí#
![Esteli](esteli.jpg)
Another Sandinista stronghold. Really amazing and/or playful murals all over the city. Known for cowboys and leather goods. Also near Somoto Canyon, a beautiful place to go cliff diving from heights of 3 ft to 20ft.
</div>

<div class="city" data-name="Matagalpa">
#Matagalpa#
![Matagalpa](matagalpa.jpg)
Known mostly for cacao and coffee farm. Check out El Castillo del Cacao, a chocolate "factory" run by two local women. There's also a decent number of nearby cloudforests and cloudfarms you can hike/stay in.
</div>

<div class="city" data-name="Isla de Ometepe">
#Isla de Ometepe#
Two huge volcanoes dominate this island, both of which are climbable. Rent a moped/ATV and get around the island. Go horseback riding. Check out some waterfalls. Grab a coconut off a drunk local.
</div>

<div class="city" data-name="Solentiname Islands">
#Solentiname Islands#
Boring. Several islands in the middle of Lago de Nicaragua near the Rio San Juan. Known for primitivist art. It's a nice look at rural island life, which is boring.
</div>

<div class="city" data-name="El Castillo">
#El Castillo#
Old spanish fort on the Rio San Juan. Has a butterfly reserve and a museum detailing its position as a fort to defend pirates. Good jumping off point to explore the Indio Maiz Reserve.
</div>

<div class="city" data-name="Refugio de Vida Silvestre Los Guatuzos">
#Los Guatuzos#
Village in the middle of the rain forest. Get here with a 8 hr boat from San Carlos. Worth. Stay with Cabanas Caiman. The owner and his wife are super friendly, great food, and lend you bikes to explore the area. Highly recommend the night tour with him. He's an amateur photographer and will position you in the best angles to selfie with crazy dangerous animals.
</div>

<div class="city" data-name="San Juan del Sur">
#San Juan Del Sur#
Drunk surfer town. Sunday Funday. Has a lot of pretty beaches all along the coast.
</div>
