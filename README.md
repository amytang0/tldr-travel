#Hello Friend!#

If there's something on the site that you felt was missing -- maybe a category 
of crucial content or perhaps something in the user experience -- please [create 
an issue](https://github.com/wangfowen/tldr-travel/issues). All feedback is 
welcome!

If I've asked you to help write a guide for a place you've been, please continue 
reading. I apologize in advance for the difficulty in contributing. Currently 
writing a guide involves a bit of coding.
